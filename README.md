# Breast Cancer Classification Model

In this project, I used breast cancer data to diagnose two classes of breast cancer, benign (0) and malignant (1).
I created classification models on various machine learning algorithms.

## Dataset

The dataset used is the University of Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset. The dataset includes measurements of breast cells and consists of 30 features.

For more information about the dataset, you can find it at [this link](https://github.com/fatiiates/breast-cancer-w-naive-bayes/blob/main/README.md).
